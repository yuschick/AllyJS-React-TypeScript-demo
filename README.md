# Accessible Web Apps with React, TypeScript & Ally.js

Accessibility is an aspect of web development that is often overlooked, at least in my experience. However, I would argue that it is as vital as overall performance and code composability. We justify our endless pursuit of better performance and responsive design by citing the end users. This is true, yes, but ultimately these pursuits are done with the user’s device in mind — not the user specifically with their potential disabilities or restrictions.

> A responsive app should be one that delivers its content based on the needs of the user, not only their device.
